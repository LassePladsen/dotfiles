# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!


  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date:"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y-%m-%d"

  # Print comment signature with date
  - triggers: [":lp:", ":signature:"]
    replace: "{{signature}}"
    vars:
      - name: signature
        type: date
        params:
          format: "LP %Y-%m-%d"

  # Print markdown code triple ````
  - trigger: ":code:"
    # replace: "```\n```"
    replace: "\u0060\u0060\u0060$|$\n\u0060\u0060\u0060"
