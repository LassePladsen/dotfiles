# If ble/contrib/integration/fzf cannot find the fzf directory, please set the
# following variable "_ble_contrib_fzf_base" manually.  The value
# "/path/to/fzf-directory" should be replaced by a path to the fzf directory
# such as "$HOME/.fzf" or "/usr/share/fzf" that contain
# "shell/{completion,key-bindings}.bash" or "{completion,key-bindings}.bash".

_ble_contrib_fzf_base=$HOME/.fzf


# Note: If you would like to combine fzf-completion with bash_completion, you
# need to load bash_completion earlier than fzf-completion.

# source -- /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
source /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh


# Set up fzf
ble-import -d integration/fzf-completion
ble-import -d integration/fzf-key-bindings

# Key bindings
ble-bind -f M-DEL 'kill-region-or kill-backward-cword' # delte backword word (stops at noncharacter like '/')
ble-bind -f M-S-DEL 'kill-region-or kill-backward-uword' # delete backword WORD (stops at whitespace)
